conda install nb_conda_kernels
conda install ipykernel
pip install --force-reinstall -v "openpyxl==3.1.0"
pip install -U scikit-learn scipy matplotlib

Create separate conda environments for both repos using requirements.txt within each repo

R2_Data_Labs_Hackathon Repo: (Optional)
1. Remove PreProcessed_Datasets folder (since we want to generate all preprocessed datasets & outputs again)
2. Run following notebooks to save model weights, variables & graphs
   a. CitySelection_SaveModel.ipynb
   b. RouteSelection_SaveModel.ipynb
   c. GeneralStats.ipynb

AIRDASHER Repo:
1. Copy the PreProcessed_Datasets/ folder in R2_Data_Labs_Hackathon repo to Analysis_Scripts/ in AIRDASHER repo. You should eventually have a folder AnalysisScripts/PreProcessed_Datasets/ in AIRDASHER repo
2. In terminal, within AIRDASHER folder, run “python manage.py runserver”
3. Open the development server to be able to access the locally hosted website
